## üìù Introduction

This assignment involves analyzing financial data using Python. The tasks include reading and cleaning 10 different datasets, performing various analyses, and visualizing the results.

## üßπ Preprocessing

Before starting the analysis, the following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Imported necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
- Loaded the datasets for each company into a dictionary of dataframes.
- Converted the `Date` column to a datetime format for easier manipulation.
- Ensured there were no missing values in critical columns used for analysis.
- And imputed the outliers

## üß© Exercises

### Exercise 1: For Each Dataset
- Print the number of rows and columns.
- Display the column names and their data types.

### Exercise 2: Extract All Rows Where the Date Is in the Year 2023
- Print the number of rows and visualize the Close price trend for this period.

### Exercise 3: For Each Company, Find the Day with the Highest Close Price
- Display it alongside the price.

### Exercise 4: Group the Data by Month and Calculate the Average Close Price
- Plot these monthly averages for 3 companies and compare them. Justify the chart selection.

### Exercise 5: For Each Company
- Compute the yearly average of the Close price.
- Plot a comparison of yearly averages for all companies on a chart. Justify your chart selection.

### Exercise 6: For Each Company
- Create a plot showing the range of prices for each month and justify the chart selection.

### Exercise 7: Create a Plot Showing the Relationship Between Trading Volume and the Close Price for a Selected Company
- Add insights about the pattern and justify your chart selection.

### Exercise 8: For Each Company
- Identify the month with the highest total trading volume.
- Display the results in a summary table, showing the month and total volume.

### Exercise 9: Merge the Datasets for All Companies into a Single Dataset, One for Each Year
- Print the structure of the combined dataset, ensuring proper alignment and handling of missing values.

### Exercise 10: For Each Company
- Calculate the spread between the High and Low prices for each day.
- Compute the average spread for each company and visualize the result in a chart. Justify the chart selection.
- Interpret which companies exhibit the largest spreads and why this might happen.
